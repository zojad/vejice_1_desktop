Enable Single Sign-on for Teams App
-------------------------

On click of Visual Studio menu Project -> Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit -> Add Authentication Code, couple of files for Single Sign-on are generated in "TeamsFx-Auth" folder, including a manifest template file for Microsoft Entra application and authentication redirect pages.  

Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit helps you generate the authentication files, then you will need to link the files to your Teams application by updating authentication configurations to make sure the Single Sign-on works for your application. Please be noted that for different Teams application type like Tab or Bot, the detailed steps are slightly different.

Basically, you will need to take care of these configurations:

* In the Microsoft Entra manifest file, you need to specify URIs such as the URI to identify the Microsoft Entra authentication app and the redirect URI for returning token. 
* In the Teams manifest file, add the SSO application to link it with Teams application. 
* Add your SSO app details to the Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit settings so that the authentication app registers with the backend and launches automatically when you debug or preview your Teams app.
